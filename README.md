# Text-Analyzer
The Text Analyzer is a C++ program designed to analyze a given text and provide insights into various textual elements. The program calculates the number of small letters, capital letters, digits, sentences, and words in the input text. Additionally, it reverses the text and capitalizes the first letter to demonstrate basic text manipulation.

**Features:**

Text Input: The program takes a sample text as input and analyzes it for various textual elements.

Small Letters, Capital Letters, and Digits: The analyzer counts the occurrences of small letters, capital letters, and digits present in the input text.

Sentences and Words: The program determines the number of sentences and words based on the presence of full stops ('.') or question marks ('?') and spaces (' ') in the input text.

Text Reversal and Capitalization: The analyzer reverses the input text and capitalizes the first letter of the reversed text.

**How to Use:**

Run the program.
Enter the text to be analyzed when prompted by the console.
The program will process the input and display various textual statistics.
It will also provide the reversed version of the input text with the first letter capitalized.
**Note:**

The Text Analyzer analyzes the first 100 characters of the input text. Any text beyond this limit will not be considered.
The program assumes that sentences end with a full stop ('.') or question mark ('?') and that words are separated by spaces (' ').
